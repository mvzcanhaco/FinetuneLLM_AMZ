the switchback design was created out of necessity to reduce the hillx2019;s natural 30percent grade, which was too steep for vehicles and pedestrians to climb. the crooked sections are 14mile long and are reserved for oneway traffic traveling downhill. lombard streetx2019;s curves and turns are world famous, and it has appeared in numerous movies, television shows, and printed materials. despite all the publicity, you still must see it.2. cable carthe san francisco cable car system is the last functioning manually operated cable car system in the world. operated by the san francisco municipal railway, the cars are housed and maintained at the car barn located directly above the cable car museum. the cable car is an icon of san francisco and a form of transportation from cities past. and it was a san franciscan, andrew smith hallidie, who patented the first cable car and ultimately spared many horses the excruciating work of moving people over some of the steepest hills in the country. a cable car ride beats any other form of transportation i have ever taken. you are in the open air with the wind blowing on your face, and the movements are all authentic x2014; bumpy and rickety. aside from being a great transportation experience, the combination of the oldstyle cable cars, steep hills, and modern buildings make the cable car a wonderfully unique photo opportunity.3.  golden gate bridgethe golden gate bridge, a symbol of san francisco, spans two of the most beautiful areas in the world the city of san francisco and the sausalitomarin headlands. built in 1937, the bridge is considered one of the most remarkable structures in the world, and the surrounding areas offer many vantage points to photograph. the golden gate bridgex2019;s 4,200foot long span set a world record, which stood forabout 27 years. the bridgex2019;s two towers rise 746 feet above the water making them 191 feet taller than the washington monument. the golden gate bridge has an art deco style with wide, vertical ribbing on the horizontal towers that help catch the sunx2019;s light at both sunrise and sunset. this feature alone makes it worth a photograph.4.  rodeo beachmarin headlandsthe marin headlands are made up of ridges and valleys, each offering its own distinct character. many charming beaches and vistas are scattered throughout. spring is when you can see an explosion of golden poppies and pastel accents of yellow, white, and lavender wildflowers blanketing the hillsides that offer wonderful scents. the marin headlands is a photographerx2019;s dream, offering unparalleled views of the pacific coast from an untamed rodeo beach, to the incredible manmade bunkers left over from the 1960s and the 150yearold lighthouse that protects ships from the high cliffs, rough seas, and dense fog.5.  downtownsan francisco is a unique and breathtaking city, known for its exquisite landscape, steep hills, and bay views. the city takes pride in its many unrivaled attractions, famous museums, and its unique neighborhoods that are like small towns within the city. each of these small neighborhoods has a variety of sites, shops, and restaurants that reflect the cityx2019;s great ethnic and cultural diversity. one of san franciscox2019;s greatest assets is the combination of old and new architecture. if you have the time, spend an hour or so walking around downtown. take your time and enjoy what you see; look around take it all in. the city has so much to offer a photographertips for photographing san franciscopanning a cable carlearning to pan is a great way to take your photography skills to the next level. photographic pan is a technique that is used for objects that are traveling in a straight line. the camera moves from left to right or right to left as it follows the subject, which is moving at the same speed. panning produces a very interesting effect that causes the subject to stay in focus while the background is blurred, creating a sense of motion that really makes a photo stand out. your camera will need to be in continuous focus nikon or ai servo canon. each manufacture calls this something different so read your manual for the correct setting. this continuous focus  allows you to do is track a moving subject. your lens adjusts and keeps your subject in focus as long as you have the shutter button half pressed. to focus on a moving object and use the panning technique, you must use a very slow shutter speed. for example, a good shutter speed for a cable car is 120 second. adjust the shutter speed as necessary for objects that are moving faster or slower.leading lines and motioni like to use leading lines to draw the viewer into the scene. a leading line can be almost anything a road, path, sidewalk, fence, river, hedge, tree line, or shadow. you will not find a strong leading line around every subject, but you should look for them if they are there and take advantage of them.  leading lines in a picture should lead into, not out of, the picture, and they should lead your eye toward the main subject. sometimes it is a matter of choosing the right angle or point of view to create this leading line effect.  not every composition will have leading lines, but when used correctly it will often improve composition.  if you want to try something fun and creative and a bit crazy okay, dangerous is more like it, this is the location for you. located in the intersection of columbus street and broadway is a pedestrian sidewalk just big enough for one person and a tripod. shoot this  image during the blue hour, which falls during rush hour in the winter months. a wideangle lens and slow shutter speed gives you a compelling image complete with leading lines, implied motion, vibrant colors, and. . danger. this is a mustframe, mustbragabout photo. just ignore the constant car horns and explicit foul comments you hear while you stand in the middle of the intersection.photographing in the fogif you have the opportunity to photograph the golden gate bridge in the fog take advantage of a chance to create a photo that is special.  photography is much to do about the perfect light so why would you want to photograph anything in the fog?  fog creates a wonderful mystical atmosphere that cant be replicated by software or filters. what makes this a special time to photograph the golden gate bridge is the protruding towers jutting through the thick blanket of fog. the glowing lights from automobiles and street lights illuminating off the dense white fog.  not only can this be the most beautiful time to photograph the golden gate bridge, it can result in the most dramatic image. when shooting into a thick blanket of fog, you need to apply a little  exposure compensation to account for the amount of underexposure your camera will do when exposing against the thick white fog. cameras metering systems tend to underexpose when shooting at white and overexpose when shooting at black. if you shoot fog at night, you need to dial in a 23 of a stop of exposure compensation to get the correct exposure.",

        "expected_output": "here are three 20thcentury violin concertos written within a 30year period in three totally different styles, played by a soloist equally at home in all of them. bernsteins serenade, the earliest and most accessible work, takes its inspiration from platossymposium; its five movements, musical portraits of the banquets guests, represent different aspects of love as well as running the gamut of bernsteins contrasting compositional styles. rorems concerto sounds wonderful. its six movements have titles corresponding to their forms or moods; their character ranges from fast, brilliant, explosive to slow, passionate, melodious. philip glasss concerto, despite its conventional three movements and tonal, consonant harmonies, is the most elusive. written in the minimalist style, which for most ordinary listeners is an acquired taste, it is based on repetition of small running figures both for orchestra and soloist, occasionally interrupted by long, high, singing lines in the violin against or above the orchestras pulsation. gidon kremer, well known for his championship of contemporary composers, plays fabulously; his tone soars, shimmers, and glows. his identification with the music is complete.edith eisler",
