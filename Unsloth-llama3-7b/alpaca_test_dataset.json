the switchback design was created out of necessity to reduce the hillx2019;s natural 30percent grade, which was too steep for vehicles and pedestrians to climb. the crooked sections are 14mile long and are reserved for oneway traffic traveling downhill. lombard streetx2019;s curves and turns are world famous, and it has appeared in numerous movies, television shows, and printed materials. despite all the publicity, you still must see it.2. cable carthe san francisco cable car system is the last functioning manually operated cable car system in the world. operated by the san francisco municipal railway, the cars are housed and maintained at the car barn located directly above the cable car museum. the cable car is an icon of san francisco and a form of transportation from cities past. and it was a san franciscan, andrew smith hallidie, who patented the first cable car and ultimately spared many horses the excruciating work of moving people over some of the steepest hills in the country. a cable car ride beats any other form of transportation i have ever taken. you are in the open air with the wind blowing on your face, and the movements are all authentic x2014; bumpy and rickety. aside from being a great transportation experience, the combination of the oldstyle cable cars, steep hills, and modern buildings make the cable car a wonderfully unique photo opportunity.3.  golden gate bridgethe golden gate bridge, a symbol of san francisco, spans two of the most beautiful areas in the world the city of san francisco and the sausalitomarin headlands. built in 1937, the bridge is considered one of the most remarkable structures in the world, and the surrounding areas offer many vantage points to photograph. the golden gate bridgex2019;s 4,200foot long span set a world record, which stood forabout 27 years. the bridgex2019;s two towers rise 746 feet above the water making them 191 feet taller than the washington monument. the golden gate bridge has an art deco style with wide, vertical ribbing on the horizontal towers that help catch the sunx2019;s light at both sunrise and sunset. this feature alone makes it worth a photograph.4.  rodeo beachmarin headlandsthe marin headlands are made up of ridges and valleys, each offering its own distinct character. many charming beaches and vistas are scattered throughout. spring is when you can see an explosion of golden poppies and pastel accents of yellow, white, and lavender wildflowers blanketing the hillsides that offer wonderful scents. the marin headlands is a photographerx2019;s dream, offering unparalleled views of the pacific coast from an untamed rodeo beach, to the incredible manmade bunkers left over from the 1960s and the 150yearold lighthouse that protects ships from the high cliffs, rough seas, and dense fog.5.  downtownsan francisco is a unique and breathtaking city, known for its exquisite landscape, steep hills, and bay views. the city takes pride in its many unrivaled attractions, famous museums, and its unique neighborhoods that are like small towns within the city. each of these small neighborhoods has a variety of sites, shops, and restaurants that reflect the cityx2019;s great ethnic and cultural diversity. one of san franciscox2019;s greatest assets is the combination of old and new architecture. if you have the time, spend an hour or so walking around downtown. take your time and enjoy what you see; look around take it all in. the city has so much to offer a photographertips for photographing san franciscopanning a cable carlearning to pan is a great way to take your photography skills to the next level. photographic pan is a technique that is used for objects that are traveling in a straight line. the camera moves from left to right or right to left as it follows the subject, which is moving at the same speed. panning produces a very interesting effect that causes the subject to stay in focus while the background is blurred, creating a sense of motion that really makes a photo stand out. your camera will need to be in continuous focus nikon or ai servo canon. each manufacture calls this something different so read your manual for the correct setting. this continuous focus  allows you to do is track a moving subject. your lens adjusts and keeps your subject in focus as long as you have the shutter button half pressed. to focus on a moving object and use the panning technique, you must use a very slow shutter speed. for example, a good shutter speed for a cable car is 120 second. adjust the shutter speed as necessary for objects that are moving faster or slower.leading lines and motioni like to use leading lines to draw the viewer into the scene. a leading line can be almost anything a road, path, sidewalk, fence, river, hedge, tree line, or shadow. you will not find a strong leading line around every subject, but you should look for them if they are there and take advantage of them.  leading lines in a picture should lead into, not out of, the picture, and they should lead your eye toward the main subject. sometimes it is a matter of choosing the right angle or point of view to create this leading line effect.  not every composition will have leading lines, but when used correctly it will often improve composition.  if you want to try something fun and creative and a bit crazy okay, dangerous is more like it, this is the location for you. located in the intersection of columbus street and broadway is a pedestrian sidewalk just big enough for one person and a tripod. shoot this  image during the blue hour, which falls during rush hour in the winter months. a wideangle lens and slow shutter speed gives you a compelling image complete with leading lines, implied motion, vibrant colors, and. . danger. this is a mustframe, mustbragabout photo. just ignore the constant car horns and explicit foul comments you hear while you stand in the middle of the intersection.photographing in the fogif you have the opportunity to photograph the golden gate bridge in the fog take advantage of a chance to create a photo that is special.  photography is much to do about the perfect light so why would you want to photograph anything in the fog?  fog creates a wonderful mystical atmosphere that cant be replicated by software or filters. what makes this a special time to photograph the golden gate bridge is the protruding towers jutting through the thick blanket of fog. the glowing lights from automobiles and street lights illuminating off the dense white fog.  not only can this be the most beautiful time to photograph the golden gate bridge, it can result in the most dramatic image. when shooting into a thick blanket of fog, you need to apply a little  exposure compensation to account for the amount of underexposure your camera will do when exposing against the thick white fog. cameras metering systems tend to underexpose when shooting at white and overexpose when shooting at black. if you shoot fog at night, you need to dial in a 23 of a stop of exposure compensation to get the correct exposure."

        "output": "here are three 20thcentury violin concertos written within a 30year period in three totally different styles, played by a soloist equally at home in all of them. bernsteins serenade, the earliest and most accessible work, takes its inspiration from platossymposium; its five movements, musical portraits of the banquets guests, represent different aspects of love as well as running the gamut of bernsteins contrasting compositional styles. rorems concerto sounds wonderful. its six movements have titles corresponding to their forms or moods; their character ranges from fast, brilliant, explosive to slow, passionate, melodious. philip glasss concerto, despite its conventional three movements and tonal, consonant harmonies, is the most elusive. written in the minimalist style, which for most ordinary listeners is an acquired taste, it is based on repetition of small running figures both for orchestra and soloist, occasionally interrupted by long, high, singing lines in the violin against or above the orchestras pulsation. gidon kremer, well known for his championship of contemporary composers, plays fabulously; his tone soars, shimmers, and glows. his identification with the music is complete.edith eisler"

        "output": "in the middle of the nightjaywalker is dreaming when the ringing of his phone jars him awake. something about hiking with his wife in the canadian rockies. he understands right away it has to have been a dream, because his wife has been dead for nearly ten years now, and he hasnt hiked the rockies in twice that long.groping in the darkness for the phone, his first fear is for his daughter. is she out driving? riding with some pimplyfaced boyfriend whos had his learners permit for two weeks now and thinks of driving as some sort of video game? then he remembers. his daughter is in her early thirties. she has a husband with no pimples, a child of her own, a career, and a house in new jersey.hello? jaywalker says into the phone, then holds his breath and readies himself for the worst. the clock radio next to the phone glows 317.pete? says an unfamiliar male voice.i think, says jaywalker, that you may have dialed the wrong number. what number were you trying to151;the line goes dead. no sorry, no oops. just a click, followed by silence and eventually a dial tone.jaywalker recradles the phone. he lies on his back in the dark, feeling his pulse pounding in his temples. relief and annoyance duel for his attention, but only briefly. for already, jaywalker is elsewhere. hes lying in bed in the dark, to be sure, but somehow his hair is brown instead of gray, his face less lined, his body more muscular. and his wife lies beside him, her warm body pressed against his back.who was it? she asks him.a mother, he says. a mother whose son has just been arrested. a rape case. and it sounds like a bad one.for them, says jaywalkers wife. but that means a good one for you, right?right, agrees jaywalker. hes not yet thirty, this younger version of him. hes been out of legal aid for a little over a year now, struggling to build a practice on his own. andstrugglingis definitely the operative word here. so he knows his wife is right whats bad for the young man and his family is at the same time good for the lawyer and his. one of the strange paradoxes of criminal law that jaywalker will never quite get comfortable with that his earning a living is dependent upon the suffering of others.what this younger jaywalker doesnt know, what he has absolutely no way of knowing at this point, as he lies in the dark, is that this new case will be different, that it will mark a crossroads in his career and in his life. should he live to be a hundred, no case that will ever come his way will end up affecting him as this one will. before hes done with it, and it with him, it will change him in ways that will be as profound as they are unimaginable. it will transform him, molding him and pounding him and shaping him into the lawyer and the man he is today, almost thirty years later. so this is more than just the case hell forever wake up to when the phone rings in the middle of the night. this is the case that hell retry in his mind over and over again for the rest of his days, changing a phrase here, adding a word there, tweaking his summation for the hundredth151;no, the thousandth151;time. and long after hes grown old and senile and has forgotten the names and faces and details of other cases, this is the one that jaywalker will remember on his deathbed, as clearly and as vividly as if it began yesterday.no doubt whatsoeverthat the case had come jaywalkers way at 317 in the morning, while unusual, was not entirely unprecedented. that it had come by way of his home telephone was actually rather typical. jaywalker had early on developed the habit of giving out his home number liberally. it was but one of many things that distinguished him from his colleagues, who never would have thought of doing such a thing, the functional equivalent of a physicians house call. moreover, as technology advanced, with the advent of beepers, pagers, car phones, cell phones and blackberries, jaywalker stuck to the practice with characteristic stubbornness, continuing to invite clients and their families to call him at home whenever the need arose. as it had apparently arisen for inez kingston on that particular night in september of 1979.then, as now, jaywalker had answered with a fearful hello? notwithstanding the fact that he knew his daughter was safely in bed upstairs and wouldnt even be of driving age for another twelve or thirteen years. whatever the circumstance, there seems to be something about the midnight phone call that inspires instant dread.mr. jaywalker? the woman had said.yes.this is inez kingston. you represented my son darren last year. maybe you remember.sure, said jaywalker. i remember. the name did sound familiar, though if pressed, he would have had trouble attaching a face to it, or recalling what the charges had been and how the case had turned out.im afraid its darren again, she said. theyve got him at the precinct. they say he raped some women. they wont tell me any more.what precinct?the fortythird.jaywalker jotted down inezs number in the dark, something hed learned to do. otherwise, brilliant ideas that came to him in the middle of the night had a way of vanishing before morning. written down on paper, they tended to lose some of their brilliance, but at least they survived.he found the number for the 43rd precinct. he knew from the precinct number that it had to be somewhere in the bronx, but other than that, he didnt have a clue. ninety percent of his practice was in manhattan, which he liked to think of in sports language as his home court. of course, at this particular stage of his career, the math wasnt all that hard to do it didnt exactly require a calculator to convert nine out of ten cases into a percentage.he reached the precinct and had the desk officer transfer his call to the squad room. there a detective confirmed that they did indeed have a darren kingston locked up. hed been booked for five separate rapes and would be making court in the morning.jaywalker thanked the detective and called inez back. he told her what hed been able to find out, and offered to meet her in court at nine oclock. before hanging up, he told her not to worry. like most people, if you woke jaywalker up in the middle of the night, he could be pretty stupid.it took him an hour or so, and the continued warmth of his wifes body pressed up against his own, but he eventually managed to fall back to sleep. he was sure inez kingston didnt.he had a car back in those days, jaywalker did. or sort of. it was an ancient volkswagen beetle, its exterior equal parts blue paint and orange rust. the running boards had fallen off, the heater was history, the wipers stuck when they werent busy scratching the windshield, and the horn worked if you were lucky enough to happen upon the sweet spot of the rim.but it was transportation, something that came in handy when youd been forced to flee the citys rich rents and poor public schools, and move to the suburbs. if bergenfield, new jersey, qualified as a suburb. what it was, was a bluecollar, workingclass community, where jaywalker could mow his own lawn, rake his own leaves and shovel his own driveway without being mistaken for a hired man. even if his wife hoped for better things, it suited him just fine.aiming the vw toward the bronx that following morning, jaywalker tried to remember what he could about darren kingston. hed been one of jaywalkers first clients after hed left legal aid. his mother, inez, worked at what today is referred to as the department of social services. back then it was the welfare department. progress, no doubt. one of inezs coworkers there was jaywalkers sisterinlaw. it had been at her suggestion that inez had called jaywalker when darren had gotten into trouble. along with two other young black men, hed been arrested for robbing an elderly white man. although the case had sounded bad at first, it turned out to be pretty harmless. one of the other defendants had done some work for the man and had had a dispute over how much money was owed him. when he went to collect, he brought his friends along. one of his friends being a knife. seeing as darren himself hadnt possessed it, had had very little involvement in the matter and had never been in any sort of trouble before, the charges against him had eventually been dropped.this time, jaywalker thought as he maneuvered around the potholes, trash and broken glass of the south bronx, he was pretty sure things werent going to be quite so easy.arraignments took place in a dark gray building at 161st street and washington avenue, half a block from the abandoned elevated tracks above third avenue. it was one of two buildings that together made up the bronx criminal court. rumor had it that both had been condemned as unsafe since the early 1950s, and in fact they would finally be abandoned a few years later, replaced by a large modern structure closer to the grand concourse.at the time, however, the decaying building was, for most people, their first encounter with what passed for bronx justice. the floors were stained and uneven. where they were supposed to be tiled, whole sections of tiles had been removed. where they were wood, they were splintered and suffering from years of dry rot. the walls were cracked and paintchipped, and covered with graffiti that was antipolice, antiwhite, antiblack, antihispanic, antigay, antijust about everything. the two elevators took turns being out of order. rather than guessing, jaywalker headed for the stairwell. just before entering, he took a deep gulp of air, then breathed through his mouth as he climbed, in order to block out as much of the stench of old urine as he could.reaching the second floor, he recognized inez kingston and her husband, marlin. she was a short, heavyset woman whose pleasant smile and soft west indian accent masked an inner nervou..."

grim, almost desperate determination as more than a dozen metropolitan police, wearing wristbands of holly, cordoned off the traffic circle while a team of d.c. firefighters set up the fire ring that would be lit just before the witching hour.harrison rand strode around the circle, overseeing the activity as the humans busily created a defense against the night39;s probable coming invasion. every month, for an hour at midnight of the full moon, the gates between the human world and esria opened. for fifteen hundred years, the esri151;the mansized, malicious creatures at the heart of the legends of fairies and elves151;had been locked out of the human world, the gates sealed, but for the one forgotten133;a gate that opened, oddly enough, into the heart of washington, dc.six months ago, an esri had stumbled upon that forgotten gate by accident, on the scent of one of the seven stones of power, and things had gone downhill fast. now all twelve gates were open and the esri39;s king rith was hellbent on tearing down the walls between the realms and enslaving the entire human race. apparently, he had the power to do it. or he would have, if he managed to get his hands on the magically powerful stones that had long ago been left in the human realm, stones that harrison and his small team had searched for and found, and now guarded with their lives.harrison39;s sole mission in life had narrowed down to one thing151;protecting humanity from the esri. and the only way any of them could do that was to reseal the gates before king rith39;s minions managed to steal back the stones, giving rith the power he sought. but sealing those gates was a damn sight easier said than done.he adjusted the combat vest that he39;d donned in case the esri came through shooting arrows this time. blasted, uncomfortable thing. the ceo of his own computer software company, his world used to be one of the office, his uniform a pair of khakis and a polo shirt. it was his brother, charlie, who39;d always been the soldier, not him. but thanks to the trace of inhuman blood that apparently ran through their veins151;esri blood from some longago immortal ancestor151;they were both soldiers now.those who couldn39;t be enchanted, the humans with that trace of esri blood151;humans the esri calledsitheen151;were the only ones who could fight this war. and the sitheen numbered only a handful.as snowflakes began to swirl, his gaze moved to the white marble fountain itself, rising high into the air like a giant chalice. in the summer, water would tumble from that high loft down into the circular base from which the carved pedestal rose.in the dead of winter, there was no water. if anything moved in that chalice tonight, it would be esri.a chill went through him that had only a little to do with the frigid air. he zipped up his parka and listened as jack and kade gave lastminute instructions to the five new sitheen recruits kade had found at area military installations and police departments.jack hallihan was a d.c. cop, six feet tall, as big or bigger than any of the recruits. kade, or kaderil the dark as he was known in esria, towered over the lot of them like they were midgets. seven feet of hardmuscled esri, the immortal was halfhuman and didn39;t look anything like his paleskinned, palehaired, slimbuilt brethren. thank god for small favors, kade was on their side now.harrison frowned. he didn39;t want to trust the esri133;anyesri. and he definitely didn39;t want to like this one. but kade had offered up his immortal life to protect the humans151;in particular, autumn, the human woman he39;d fallen in love with. it was hard to hate a guy like that.but that didn39;t mean he couldn39;t hate the rest of the raping, murderous bastards. and he did. he despised them with a fury he sometimes thought would choke him.six months ago, an esri had touched harrison39;s sevenyearold daughter, stephie. he39;d just placed his white hand on her head, but whatever he39;d done to her had made her scream and scream. and when the screaming had finally stopped, her mind had flown to a place no one could reach. she remained in a catatonic state from which doctors and harrison39;s exwife feared she might never recover. god alone knew what that monster had done to her. all harrison knew was that the esri were powerful, dangerous, magical beings. and he would do everything in his power to stop the bastards. which meant getting these damned gates sealed again.for the hundredth time since he39;d arrived at dupont circle tonight, he pulled out his cell phone, making certain it was still on.if only charlie would call. his exnavy seal brother had gone through the gate last month on a hailmary mission to free the captive esri princess, ilaria151;the one they believed had sealed the gates between the worlds fifteen centuries ago.to beg her to seal them again.dammit, charlie, call me.he knew his brother had taken a cell phone. if he came through one of the other gates, he39;d call. and considering midnight fell at different times in different places151;and they suspected most of the gates opened into northern europe151;that should have happened at least a couple of hours ago.they thought. they really didn39;t know squat about these gates.come on, charlie. call me, little brother. tell me you and tarrys got the princess.tarrys, a pretty little exslave from the esri world had accompanied him through the gate, intending to keep an eye on him.tell me you made it out of there alive.jack39;s wife, larsen, joined him, her blond hair tucked beneath the hood of her dark green parka. larsen had been one of the first sitheen targeted by the esri, one of the first to understand that the bleachedskinned, murdering rapist she alone saw clearly, wasn39;t human.34;any word?34; she asked softly. she was an attractive woman. a lawyer, if they ever got their lives back. jobs no longer meant much when they faced an evil bent on the destruction of their world.34;no. nothing.34;her hand went to his arm as if he might need some strengthening or commiseration at charlie39;s lack of communication, but harrison was more than used to this. charlie had always been the more adventurous of the two, even before dad left on a business trip with his young female assistant and never bothered to come home, propelling mom into a deep and abiding relationship with the liquor cabinet. afterward, his brother had turned wild and still seemed to thrive on danger. harrison had long ago accepted the fact that sooner or later charlie wouldn39;t return from one of his missions.for the sake of the world, he just hoped this wasn39;t the one.34;charlie warned it might take time to reach the princess,34; larsen said. 34;if he doesn39;t make it out of there this month, he39;ll come back next.34;harrison nodded once. there was nothing to say to that. charlie would make it or he wouldn39;t. unfortunately, if he didn39;t return, they might never know his fate. he could be captured and imprisoned. or enslaved. he could desperately need their help and they39;d never know.as his stomach threatened to turn into a mass of knots, he took a deep breath and forced the tension out with an exhale. in his mind, he retreated to that dark, colorless room devoid of emotion. another breath. calm, controlled.34;if it39;s any consolation, i haven39;t had any visions.34;he met larsen39;s gaze, understanding her meaning. many of the sitheen seemed to have inherited some kind of fairy gift from their esri ancestors. larsen foresaw death, the deaths of other sitheen. no visions meant charlie was still alive.probably.34;that39;s something,34; harrison murmured.larsen gave him a hopeful little smile and turned away. but she39;d gone no more than two steps when she suddenly jerked, as if she39;d been struck.instinctively, harrison39;s gaze flew to the gate, assuming she39;d seen something. but no dark forms leaped from the base of the fountain. larsen swayed. understanding hit him like a body slam. she was having a vision. larsen was watching someone die.he grabbed her by the shoulders, steadying her. 34;jack!34;jack hallihan39;s dark head snapped up, his body leaping into motion as he ran for his wife. as jack pulled larsen into his arms, he looked up, harrison39;s own despair mirrored in his eyes. together, they waited to find out which of them she was watching die.please, god, don39;t let it be charlie. i can39;t warn him. i can39;t help him change his fate.larsen finally stirred, turning her head to press one cheek against jack39;s shoulder, revealing a tearstreaked face as pale as any esri39;s.34;what did you see?34; jack asked softly, stroking her cheek with his thumb.she lifted her hand to cover her mouth, as if struggling for control, and harrison knew they weren39;t going to like the answer. finally, she pulled out of jack39;s embrace and swiped at the tears. though visibly shaken, the woman was tough. with a deep, shuddering breath, she met their gazes, one after the other.34;i saw ten or twelve slaves come through the gate first, all shooting arrows. fifteen or twenty esri flew through after.34; she opened her mouth to continue, then squeezed her eyes closed as more tears ran down her cheeks.jack gripped her shoulder, offering her strength as they both waited silently for her to continue. as bad as harrison knew her vision had been, one thought kept racing through his head. so far, it was about them, not charlie. and they could change it.larsen got control again and continued, her bottom lip unsteady. 34;most of us die from arrows through the neck and head.34;34;the vests aren39;t going to be enough,34; jack murmured.34;no. and those who don39;t die from t..."

        "output": "robert kaplan has reported from locales as diverse and chaotic as shantytowns in the ivory coast, death camps in cambodia, and the frontlines of the warravaged balkans, but his most challenging assignment may have been covering his own country. in this ambitious and evocative study, kaplan vividly chronicles his travels into americas future, a journey that begins in fort leavenworth, kansasthe starting point for what would one day be called manifest destinyand continues across the west, where the population is growing faster than anywhere else in the country and multiple american identities reveal a nation in flux. he explores cities such as st. louis and omaha, nebraska, that typify the increased urban fragmentation of the heartland; onward to tucson, arizona, and santa fe, new mexico, where great wealth and poverty exist cheek by jowl; through the sprawl of multiethnic southern california, where the landscape is perched somewhere between urban and suburban; and up through the pacific northwest into canada. he also visits towns along the u.s.mexico border, dipping as far south as mexico city, to investigate the conditions driving so many mexicans north, despite feverish efforts by the u.s. to keep them out, and the new cultural hybrid being formed by this migration.kaplan uncovers a nation polarized along ethnic, economic, and political lines, where the uneven distribution of rapid technological advances allows some groups to surge forward, cultivating a radically different worldview than their poorer, less educated neighbors. much of his report is bleak, but despite his insistence on documenting the worst, plenty of examples of prosperity and hope appear in these pages. what comes across most clearly is that there is still plenty of room for speculation on exactly how and where the new boundaries will be drawn. in this respect, americas future still carries the promise of the wild west equal parts opportunity, possibility, and uncertainty.shawn carkonen"

may harm or damage the gear. if your gear is damaged, and the damage is due to improper use or wear and tear, you will receive an estimate of the cost of repair. if the damage is due to a defect in material or workmanship, the product will either be repaired at sitkas cost or replaced by sitka.sitka gear product designsitka had a simple goal to introduce to the hunting industry a system of clothing that incorporates the latest highperformance fabrics with a mountaineering design philosophy. with sitkas continued growth of experience and expertise, its focus becomes more defined as it develops specific solutions for specific uses. it doesnt cut corners, it doesnt appeal to the masses. sitka sometimes gets it wrong, but you cant get it right without trying.the sitka system is based on a triedandtrue layering system. a system that revolves around base, insulation, and outerwear with a very simple goal moisture management. at the highest level, the concept is straightforward. base layers move moisture away from your skin, keeping you warm when its cold, and cool and when its hot. this is the foundation. insulation and outerwear are your control pieces that are adjusted in response to weather and activity levels that continue the process of moisture management.these same principles apply to the elk hunter in montana, the sheep hunter in alaska, and the whitetail hunter in missouri. the systems are more specific for each hunter and each trip, but the same principles always apply.about sitka gearfounded in 2005, sitka gear was an idea spawned by necessity. like many stories, this one started out as an epic journey that culminated with a clear vision. after 3,000 vertical feet in the dark, with intermittent snow flurries and driving sleet, the morning climb ended behind a gnarled white bark pine to get some reprieve from the elements and a little food in the bellies. cold and wet with sweat from that climb, it was more than obvious that discomfort like this was unnecessary.so, on that september morning, at timberline, surrounded by bugling bulls, the vision that became sitka was realized. drawing on strong backgrounds in the climbing, mountaineering, and general headstrong assaults of the backcountry, the company founders focused on bridging the gaps that existed between these endeavors.sitkas driving goal is not only to bridge the technology gaps that existed from a fabric, construction, and productform perspective but to be fully immersed in driving new technologies and solutions for the modern outdoorsman. sitkas roots are in the mountains, but its solutions range widely. it could be said that sitka simply makes the best highperformance system of hunting clothes on the market, but its more than just quality. its a philosophy turning clothing into gear."

        "output": "jared taylor is arguably the most brilliant of the leaders of what is sometimes called the alternative right, the intellectual movement focused on emergent issues that are now systematically suppressed in americas purblind public debate. this book, the long awaited sequel to his seminalpaved with good intentions, will eventually be seen as a decisive step forward on the historic american nations road to recovery from the paralyzing curse of political correctness.34;peter brimelow, editor of vdare.com and author ofalien nation common sense about americas immigration disaster34;in this brilliant and wideranging survey of the relevant science and history, jared taylor shows that racial consciousness is intrinsic and that efforts to remake human nature are doomed to fail. he shows that in modern america, people of all races prefer the company of people of their own race; that racial diversity is more often a source of conflict than of strength; and that multiculturalism is changing the united states profoundly and to the detriment of most white people.34;dr. raymond wolters, keith professor of history, university of delaware34;the work of an insightful, welltempered, and above all, demandingly honest mind, white identity is especially timely as the white population of america comes under intensifying demographic, political, cultural, and economic pressure from both within and without. jared taylor deserves our deep gratitude for declaring that whites must find a way to stand up for themselves in a world in which they are becoming a shrinking minority, even in their own once whitemajority countries.34;prof. j. philippe rushton, department of psychology, university of western ontario34;jared taylor offers the reader an open, honest, and frank discussion of the reality of race and race relations in america today. he convincingly argues that unless all the facts, painful or politically inconvenient though they may be, are laid bare then all that follows will be based on false assumptions and doomed to failure.34;dr. roger d. mcgrath, authorhistoriantelevision commentator34;white identitymakes shocking and painful reading for any white person who fears for the future of the united states. it is about the relentless demise of whites, about the loss of will to survive, even about the death of whites globally. as jared taylor demonstrates in a relentless barrage of data and statistics, whites are being racially, culturally and physically dispossessed by nonwhites. the acceptance of multiculturalism as something beneficial when it is barely concealed and often explicit antiwhite racism renders whites uniquely vulnerable to the organized racial solidarity of nonwhites. i retain hope. i retain this hope because of the author himself. jared taylor embodies all the virtues that made the american republic physical courage, wisdom, love of learning, an indomitable spirit and pointblank refusal to live by the lie.34;dr. frank ellis, formerly of university of nevada, las vegas and university of leeds34;jared taylor documents the dire consequences of demographic change in the united states. he warns of the deterioration that will follow when and if whites become a minority, and sounds a much needed wakeup call for whites to regain their sense of racial consciousness.34;dr. richard lynn, professor emeritus of psychology, university of ulster34;if you dont like letting facts ruin your fantasies about race relations and diversity stay away from this book!34;dr. anthony hilton, associate professor of psychology retired, concordia university, montrealfear of an erudite whiteby jim goadwhite identityis jared taylors first fulll houston conservative examinerfew men in america are as reviled by the liberal establishment as jared taylor, editor ofamerican renaissance. according to the southern poverty law center splc, he is 34;a courtly presenter of ideas that most would consider crudely white supremacist.34; keep in mind that the splc is an organization that cites thomas fleming, editor of this magazine, 11 times on its website for his association with such 34;hate groups34; as the league of the south and the notorious rockford institute. if you are reading this madazine, you are already tainted. if you buy jared taylors new book, you probably risk investigation by the atf or some clandestine civilrightsenforcement organization. even reading this review could endanger your voting rights in the new world order.now that you have been forewarned, allow me to summarize taylors argument the architects of the civilrights movement, who sought to build a colorblind, fully integrated society, have achieved only a pyrrhic victory. if minorities are well represented in our public institutions, our schools and colleges, our sports, and in the media, pervasive segregation persists in virtually every form of volutnary association. the ideology of multiculturalsim, while it celebrates 34;diversity,34; is little more than a cover for a divisive racial poer politics intended to demonize whites and impose upon them a disabling burden of guilt and selfloathing. while blacks, hispanic, asians, and other minorities are encouraged to express racial solidarity, whites who attempt to do the same are branded as racists covertly seeking to restore white supremacy. unchecked immigration across the mexicanamerican border is permanently altering not only the complexion but the character of american life. by midcentury, america will be a mosaic of minority cultures, each competing fiercely for its share of power and federal largesse. given this reality, whites can no longer afford the luxury of disdain for racialidentity politics. whites today, taylor writes, 34;have a choice regain a sense of identity and the resolve to maintain their numbers, their traditions, and their way of lifeor face oblivion.34;taylor is among the few who have taken an unflinching look at the reality of racial segregation in contemporary american life. while in the past it was almost universally assumed that segregation was a direct consequence of white discrimination and everything to do with ethnic preference and political advantage. many blacks now see the integrationist ideal as merely a political tool that has served its purpose. as leon williams wrote in a letter to the editor published in 2004 by thephiladelphia inquirer,there is nothing wrong with segregation. most african americans with good sense want the same relations that most whites want. we dont want them living in our neighborhoods. we dont want our children going to school with theirs. . we dont need tea and cookies and fireside chats with white people.taylor makes a strong case that such attitudes, while not universal among blacks, are widespread. education has, of course, been among the most hotly contested terrains in the struggle for equal opportunity. blacks were once fervent supporters of publicschool integration, but today many leaders in the black community are profoundly disillusioned with the official integrationist position of naacp and have become advocates of segregated education, especially charter schools designed to serve black children.jack trotter,chroniclesaugust 2011white identity racial consciousness in the 21st century, by jared taylorby brett stevenspeople dont like to talk about it these days, but a big part of conservatism is racial identity what was once called 34;nationalism,34; when nation meant the ethnicity in which you were born.jared taylor, a yale graduate and independent businessman, has for the last two decades run an organization calledamerican renaissancethat addresses the national question. namely how do we get beyond 34;diversity,34; which doesnt work for anyone, and rediscover our nationalist roots?naturally this upsets leftists. they claim to be tolerant of everything, but anything they dont like they accuse of being either elitist, racist, sexist, homophobic, antifat, social darwinism, satan, etc. leftists want you to think that you either think multiculturalism is double plus good, or youre a fascist. no middle ground!taylors newest book,white identity racial consciousness in the 21st century, will dispel these spurious claims because it does not just focus on white identity. rather, it explores nationalist and identitarian politics and viewpoints in four racial groups africanamericans, asians, hispanics and whites.through meticulously researched content, taylor proves that a diversity is failing despite massive government efforts b each racial or ethnic group seeks its own selfrule and identity, and in fact most prefer segregation c that racial identity is healthy for members of all ethnic groups and d that 34;diversity34; and 34;multiculturalism34; not only are failing now, but portend a future of continued failure that will harm all ethnic groups.sleek but not slick prose flows through this readable and engaging text, using numerous examples from both scientific publications and the mainstream news. arguments are cleanly constructed and stand alone. it is an impressive work that will bring food for thought to anyone brave enough to consider the analysis it offers.if you want a respite from the dogmatic racebaiting of mainstream politics, and a more scientific and historical viewpoint that is both balanced and compassionate but also logical and focused on the long term,white identity racial consciousness in the 21st centuryby jared taylor is an enjoyable and informative read. houston conservative examiner"
